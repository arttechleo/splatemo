# Auto-Push to Git After Local Testing

## Workflow Rule

After making code changes and verifying they work locally, **automatically push to git**.

## Process

1. **Make changes** - Edit files as requested
2. **Test locally** - Verify the changes work (run dev server, check for errors, etc.)
3. **Commit changes** - Stage and commit with a descriptive message
4. **Push to remote** - Push to the current branch (usually `main`)

## Git Commands

When changes are complete and tested:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"
git push origin <branch-name>
```

## Commit Messages

- Be descriptive and specific about what changed
- Reference the task/feature if applicable
- Keep messages concise but informative

## Exceptions

- **Don't push** if the user explicitly asks not to
- **Don't push** if there are uncommitted changes from other work
- **Don't push** if the working tree is dirty with unrelated changes
- **Ask first** if unsure about pushing (e.g., force push scenarios)

## Testing Before Push

Before pushing, ensure:
- Code compiles without errors
- No obvious runtime errors
- Changes work as intended
- No sensitive data is committed

## Branch Handling

- Default to `main` branch unless another branch is active
- Use `git push origin <current-branch>` to push to the current branch
- If branch is behind remote, consider `git pull` first or inform the user
